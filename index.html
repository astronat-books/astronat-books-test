                <h2>My Collection</h2>
                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>
                    Hi! My name is Natalie and I am a 20-year-old science student and educator from Sydney, Australia. I have been interested
                    in collecting books since high school, where I fell in love with the 1980s Coroneos textbook my Year 11 maths teacher showed
                    us - something about the typewritten pages littered with hand-drawn diagrams was so much more appealing than the computer-generated
                    textbooks I had for all my other subjects.
                    <br>
                    My collection currently comprises around thirty books on various STEM topics, predominantly astronomy and physics. I collect
                    these areas as they align with what I am currently studying in my third year of my Bachelor of Science. I find it invaluable to have
                    access to the history of the modern concepts I hear about in my lectures, as I believe science is at its most valuable when we acknowledge
                    how it has developed over time. To quote my 2023 entry to the Young Book Collector's Prize:
                    <div class = "quotebox">
                        <i>
                            "I collect books to preserve knowledge and use it to inform both myself and others. When my astrophysics homework leaves me lost, I 
                            have hundreds of years of background information to set me on the right path. When my young students bombard me with “why” in response 
                            to whatever answer I give them, I am prepared to take them on a journey through decades of technological advancement. When the world is 
                            faced with uncertainty, I know I have the voices of thousands of academics, scientists, and researchers preserved in ink, and an internet 
                            connection through which to share it."
