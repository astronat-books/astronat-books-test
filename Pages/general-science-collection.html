                    </i></b> 
                    is the oldest book in my collection (so far), and definitely the catalyst for my obsession with 
                    1800s volumes - it doesn't quite fit with what I usually collect, but that beautiful marbling 
                    convinced me to buy it.<br>
                    Covering a vast range of topics (and I mean that in the most literal sense), this guidebook 
                    introduces topics in geology, astronomy, biology, chemistry and physics, aimed at "young 
                    gentlemen".<br>
                    Possibly it's most unique feature is a chapter covering over 150 "Conversational Topics", covering 
                    everything from the Aurora Borealis to stilton cheese (which can conveniently be found on the same 
                    page).

                    <b><i>Year Twelve 3 Unit Course</i></b> was the first "old" book I saw, as my Year 11 maths teacher 
                    had a copy from the 90s that he bought in one day. I was mesmerised by the intricate hand-drawn 
                    illustrations, and it was so unlike any of my other textbooks that when I saw this copy at the USYD
                    Chancellor's Book Fair in 2023, I just knew I had to have it.<br>
                    Jim Coroneos was a Sydney high school teacher...<br>
                    Dating this book has been quite a challenge, as there is no date listed anywhere in the book, and my
