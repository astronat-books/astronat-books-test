                <h2>Harry Messel - Physicist and Educator</h2>
                Harry Messel was an Emeritus Professor at the University of Sydney. He was appointed Head of the School 
                of Physics in 1952, and established the Nuclear Research Foundation (now the Physics Foundation) in 
                1954, in order to raise funds to develop and support research in the School of Physics, raising more 
                than $130 million in his 35-year tenure for projects such as SILLIAC, the second computer in Australia, 
                and the International Science School alongside an integrated science syllabus in high schools.<br>
                <h2>The NRFSSS (now ISS)</h2>
                From its establishment in 1958 until 1962, the Nuclear Research Foundation Summer Science School was 
                targeted towards high school teachers, but was later opened to students from Australia and around the 
                world. Each year featured a line-up of international scientists from fields including atomic physics,
                astrophysics and space rocketry. Noteable guest speakers included astrophysicist Julius Sumner Miller,
                mathematician and cosmologist Hermann Bondi, and astronaut Alan Shepard.<br>
                The NRFSSS, now renamed the International Science School, still occurs on a bi-yearly basis, bringing 
                students together from around the world to hear about the latest research from leading academics and 
                scientists.<br>
                <h2>The Books</h2>
                Each year, the lectures presented at the ISS were compiled, printed and distributed to schools in order 
                to make the science they contained more accessible. My collection comprises those from 1960-1968 
                inclusive, all first editions/printings from Shakespeare Head Press. My goal is to compile the first 
                decade of publications (although the first two books, from 1958 and 1959 respectively, remain incredibly 
                scarce). These books, especially having been published in the years leading up to the Apollo Moon 
                landings, contain a wealth of information on the most "recent" scientific advances. I find it invaluable 
                to have the context behind what I study (Bachelor of Science, majoring in physics and data science) at 
                my fingertips - I discuss this topic further in my essay, 
                <a href = "essay.html">The Misadventures of Misinformation</a>.

                    <h2>Man in Inner and Outer Space</h2>
                    <h4><i>S. T. Butler, H. Messel (Editors), 1968 (First Edition)</i></h4>

                    The lectures presented at the 11th International Science School, compiled within <b><i>Man in Inner 
                    and Outer Space (1968)</i></b>, are probably some of my favourite in my whole collection. The 
                    lecturers, including [WHO], encompass topics such as... <br>
                    I was a bit disappointed as the only copies available online were ex-library, and I had almost 
                    accepted that was the best I would get when I saw a listing on Abe for this copy, "signed by one of 
                    the authors". I sent a message to the seller to clarify if it was Messel or Butler's signature, and 
                    he sent an image of the inscription - to a "Chairman Miller", from Harry Messel.<br>
                    Jackpot.<br>
                    The seller didn't know who the "Chairman Miller" was (and nor did I initially), which definitely 
                    helped me get it for such a reasonable price, but part of the fun of book collecting is researching 
                    provenance. When asked where the book came from, the seller told me it had been donated from a local 
                    university (being based in California), but apart from that he didn't know.<br>
                    Julius Sumner Miller was an American physicist and science educator, who worked at El Camino College 
                    in California, and made numerous visits to Australia throughout his career to contribute lectures to 
                    the International Science School. He was also the host of "Why Is It So?", a popular science show 
                    broadcast on the ABC, and the daily "Millergrams" published in newspapers to get the country 
                    thinking about science. <br>
                    To own a copy of such an incredible book, and to know that it was owned by such an incredible 
                    scientist and educator - as a scientist and educator myself, I look up to both Miller and Messel so 
                    much, and this is such a valuable addition to my collection.
